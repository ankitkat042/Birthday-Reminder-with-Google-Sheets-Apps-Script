# üéÇ Birthday Reminder with Google Sheets & Apps Script

I used to forget birthdays, even for people I really care about. Of course, I remember birthdays of my closest ones, but I care for too many awesome people to remember them all!

So I built this little tool: a Google Apps Script that reminds me every day whose birthday it is. It‚Äôs simplea nd just works, and it can help you remember the birthdays of people you care about too :)

Feel free to use it, improve it, or suggest changes, I'm open to improvements!

## ‚ú® What It Does

- Checks a Google Sheet every day for birthdays.
- Sends you an email if it's someone's birthday today.
- If the year of birth is included, it tells you how old they‚Äôre turning!
- Automatically runs daily once you set it up.

## üìã Sheet Format

Create or copy a Google Sheet with the following structure (start from row 2):

| Name        | Birthday    |
|-------------|-------------|
| Ankit Kumar | 01/01       |
| JD   | 15/05/1995  |
| AG | 07/08       |

>The script supports:
> - `dd/mm` (e.g., `15/05`)
> - `dd/mm/yyyy` (e.g., `15/05/1995`)
>
> Only `/` is supported as the separator (not `-` or `.`).

Now just add the list of birthdays in the spreadsheet and the script will handle everything else, but do not forget to run the script at least once to give permissions.
